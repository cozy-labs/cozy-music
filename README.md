# \[DEPRECATED\] [Cozy](https://cozy.io) Music

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cozy-labs/cozy-music.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cozy-labs/cozy-music)

Cozy Music allows you to hear all the sounds you uploaded in Cozy Files and add more music from streaming service.

* Pick up an [issue](https://github.com/cozy-labs/cozy-music/issues?state=open) and solve it.
